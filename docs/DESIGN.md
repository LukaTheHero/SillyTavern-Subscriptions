# SillyTavern-Subscriptions — design notes

This plugin fuses three earlier plugins (SillyTavern-ClaudeSubscription,
SillyTavern-CodexSubscription, SillyTavern-GeminiSubscription) into one server
plugin + one UI panel. This file records the decisions that are not obvious
from the code.

## Why one plugin

Three plugins meant three listeners (8901/8902/8903), three panels each
injecting its own `custom_include_body` block, three copies of the same SSE /
stop-sequence / folding code, and — the actual failure the user hit — two of
the server plugins were never installed while their panels were, so "Connect"
pointed at ports nobody listened on.

Now: **one listener (8901), one model list, one panel**. The provider is
inferred from the model id (`claude-*`, `gpt-*`/`o*`, `gemini-*`); the panel's
"Connect to" scope only decides which prefix the endpoint uses (`/v1`,
`/claude/v1`, `/codex/v1`, `/gemini/v1`) and therefore which models the list
shows.

## Request settings channel

SillyTavern forwards `custom_include_body` (YAML) unconditionally for Custom
sources, so the panel injects (merged into the user's own Include Body as a
structured object, with SillyTavern's bundled YAML library):

```yaml
subscriptions:
  show_reasoning: true
  claude: { backend, effort, thinking, thinking_budget, identity_mode, use_resume, fast_mode }
  codex:  { backend, effort, service_tier, reasoning_summary, verbosity }
  gemini: { backend, effort }
```

The three legacy namespaces (`claude_subscription`, `codex_subscription`,
`gemini_subscription`) are still parsed so an old panel keeps working during
migration. Precedence: unified namespace > legacy namespace > OpenAI
`reasoning_effort` / `verbosity`. Fast mode (it draws Extra Usage) is read only
from the namespaces, never from a generic top-level field.

Requests sent through Connection Manager profiles never fire
`CHAT_COMPLETION_SETTINGS_READY`, so they arrive without the block and get the
server defaults. There is deliberately no server-side "default settings"
store: it would apply billing choices to every client of the listener.

## Reading the message list

`partitionConversation()` (lib/common/messages.js) is the single reading all
three providers share:

* only the **leading** run of system messages is the system prompt;
* later system messages (Author's Note / World Info at depth, Impersonate,
  quiet prompts, group nudges, post-history instructions) become user turns
  **in place**, adjacent user turns merged — the same conversion
  SillyTavern's own Claude converter does;
* a reply is a continuation/prefill **only** when the literal last message is
  an assistant message. The continued message stays in the history (the
  model sees its own words as its turn), followed by the plain
  "[Continue your last message…]" instruction.

## Backends per provider

| Provider | `subscription` | `api` | `auto` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | Agent SDK with the Claude login, account-isolated (below) | SDK with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + key/token and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` pointed at an empty plugin dir so the OAuth login is invisible | the subscription first; a quota-exhausted reply (or a rate limit that outlasts the retries) retries the same request on the API key when one exists. A key existing, or a login the plugin cannot see, never switches billing. |
| Codex | app-server, `modelProvider: "openai"`, only for a ChatGPT login (`account/read` type `chatgpt`); an API-key login is refused | direct OpenAI-compatible HTTP when a key exists (clean `messages[]`), else app-server with the non-OpenAI provider from `config.toml` | app-server exactly as the CLI is configured (so a provider switch made in the CLI is honoured); direct HTTP when no CLI but a key |
| Gemini | `agy` print mode on the Google sign-in; refused when agy's settings route it to an API key / relay | direct HTTP with the key to its paired base URL (default: Google's OpenAI-compatible endpoint) | agy as configured, else key |

Default backend is `subscription` for every provider — this is a subscription
plugin, so a key is only ever billed after the user opts in (Auto or API).

## Claude specifics

* **Agent SDK ≥ 0.3.285** (bundled Claude Code 2.1.285). The CLI version
  decides model support: Opus 5.5 needs 2.1.280+, Sonnet 5.5 2.1.284+, Fable
  2.1.251+. `/status` reports the CLI version next to the SDK version.
* The catalog mirrors the CLI's baked model table: context window (native 1M
  vs a `[1m]` beta variant), thinking family (always / adaptive / hybrid /
  budget) and effort levels. The CLI does the final request shaping (it drops
  `disabled` on always-thinking models, turns adaptive into a budget on old
  models, lowers unsupported effort levels); the plugin mirrors it to log
  honestly and to avoid 400s. `[1m]` on a native-1M model resolves to the
  plain model; on Opus/Sonnet 4.6 it uses the tier alias + env pin.
* **Isolation recipe** (everything verified by capturing the exact request
  body against a local server):
  * options: custom `systemPrompt` (`snapshot: false`), `tools: []`,
    `skills: []`, `settingSources: []`, `mcpServers: {}` + `strictMcpConfig`,
    `verbatimPrompts` (no `@file` expansion, no slash commands, no turn-start
    attachments), `permissionMode: 'dontAsk'` (bypass mode exits as root),
    a fixed `title` (no title-generation side call), `persistSession: false`
    on the non-resume paths;
  * env (lib/claude/env.js): every `ANTHROPIC_*` / `CLAUDE_CODE_*` / `OTEL_*`
    and thinking/caching/compaction override scrubbed; attachments, git
    instructions, the token-count reminder, terminal titles, auto-compaction
    and claude.ai MCP connectors off;
  * account: with a full login the CLI injects the account email — from its
    account record, and when that is missing it fetches the profile itself
    (verified live: redirecting only `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, with
    `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` pointing back at the real login, still
    leaked it). With a bare token in `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` it has no
    profile. So the subprocess gets empty plugin-owned config and
    secure-storage dirs plus the login's access token (read from the
    credentials file or the macOS Keychain item — named exactly as the CLI
    names it — and refreshed by the plugin; the CLI cannot refresh an env
    token). No usable token → an actionable 401, never a silent fallback;
    `ST_SUBSCRIPTIONS_CLAUDE_ISOLATE_ACCOUNT=0` is the explicit opt-out.
  * billing guard: the CLI resolves credentials itself (a /login-managed
    Console key or an `ant` profile can outrank the claude.ai login). Every
    path streams its prompt, held behind a gate until
    `initializationResult()` shows `apiKeySource` none/oauth and a
    first-party provider; otherwise the query is aborted before anything is
    sent.
  * what remains: the mandatory billing header + one-line agent identity
    (subscription auth requires it) and a short environment note (working
    directory, git flag, platform, shell, OS, model name, date). The only
    switch for the latter
    (`CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE`) also disables OAuth.
* **Working directory matters to the safety classifier.** The environment
  note shows the working directory. With the drive root or a nondescript
  folder, Opus 5.5's classifier refused plain roleplay lines as "cyber"
  (deterministically); from a folder named like a chat app it answered. The
  subprocess runs in `<plugin>/.runtime/SillyTavern-chat` (nothing is written
  there). A cwd inside the Claude desktop app's virtualised AppData also
  fails to spawn (`ENOTCONN`).
* **No model substitution, ever.** The CLI's refusal fallback (e.g. Opus 5.5 →
  Opus 5 / 4.8), same-model refusal retry, model-access fallback and legacy
  remap are switched off by env. Refusals are detected structurally
  (`model_refusal_no_fallback`, `stop_reason: "refusal"`) and are final. The
  served-model guard (init, every `message_start`, every assistant message)
  compares canonical ids for every model, as a backstop.
* Thinking budgets: the CLI raises a budget below 1024 to 1024 even when
  `max_tokens` is smaller, and the API accepts that with interleaved
  thinking (verified live on Haiku 4.5), so 3.0's "no thinking under 2048
  max tokens" guard is gone.
* **Max response length.** When a reply hits `max_tokens` the CLI injects
  hidden "resume" turns up to three times. The plugin aborts at the first
  `message_delta` with `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` and finishes with
  `finish_reason: "length"`. Partial messages are always on internally; text
  is forwarded only from `text` blocks.
* The CLI reports locally generated errors as an assistant message with
  `model: "<synthetic>"`; its text *is* the error.
* Synthetic session resume (`resume` + one-shot `SessionStore`) gives real
  multi-turn context and prompt caching. The SDK materialises the history in
  its own temp config dir and deletes it when the subprocess exits.
* Error classifiers match HTTP status codes only as status codes ("API
  Error: 429", "(429)") — bare digits appear in token counts, message indexes
  and request ids.

## Codex specifics

* `codex exec --json` gives no token streaming; `codex app-server` (JSON-RPC
  over stdio) streams `item/agentMessage/delta`, reasoning summaries, token
  usage and rate limits, accepts `baseInstructions` (replacing the coding
  system prompt), `ephemeral: true` threads, and `turn/interrupt` (used for
  stop sequences and client disconnects). One process is kept alive; threads
  are released with `thread/unsubscribe` (ephemeral threads cannot be deleted).
* Isolation uses `-c` overrides only (an unknown key never breaks startup):
  the agent features (shell, patch, web search, MCP resources, multi-agent…)
  off, the environment/permissions/apps/collaboration/skills prompt blocks
  off, `project_doc_max_bytes=0`, `developerInstructions: ''`, read-only
  sandbox, approval policy `never`, every approval request refused, and any
  tool item that still starts ends the turn as an error. Codex still declares
  `apply_patch` and `request_user_input` (attached per model family, no
  switch); the sandbox, the fileChange guard and the auto-answered input
  request neutralise them. On "Subscription only" an `openai_base_url` /
  `chatgpt_base_url` pointing at a non-OpenAI host is refused (it would carry
  the ChatGPT token). After `initialize`
  the effective config (`config/read`) is checked; an MCP server that is
  still enabled means one relaunch with it off, then fail closed.
* The global `AGENTS.md` in the Codex home is always injected and has no
  switch; `thread/start` reports it in `instructionSources`, and a non-empty
  one refuses the chat before any model call.
* `model/rerouted` and cyber/misalignment policy errors are hard errors; a
  `thread/start` that reports a different model is refused. `ultra` effort is
  sent as `max` (or `xhigh`) — `ultra` switches Codex to multi-agent mode.
* Model catalog is live (`model/list`), then `models_cache.json`, then a static
  snapshot. Efforts are clamped to what the model supports.

## Gemini specifics

* Prompt on **stdin** with `--input-format text` (no `-p`): avoids the
  command-line length limit on long chats.
* Every turn runs a plugin-owned workspace agent
  (`.runtime/gemini-cwd/.agents/agents/st-subscriptions-chat/agent.md`:
  `inheritCustomizations: false`, `inheritMcp: false`,
  `excludeDefaultComponents: true`, `tools: []`) with `--sandbox` and
  `--disable-slash-commands`. agy silently falls back to its default agent for
  an unknown `--agent`, so each run writes its own log and the turn is killed
  if the log shows the fallback. Any tool step kills the process tree.
* agy re-asks a safety-blocked prompt once, in-process, before the plugin
  can stop it (no switch for that in 1.2.14); the runner then kills the turn
  and returns a 422 refusal — nothing from the retry reaches the client. Use
  the API backend when a strict wire-level no-retry matters. Persistent 429s
  end the turn after ~11 s instead of waiting for the watchdog. agy also adds
  the host's local time to each turn.
* agy never streams thoughts in stream-json mode; reasoning display only
  works on the `api` backend. Images are not supported on the agy path.

## HTTP layer

* Cancellation: one AbortController per chat request, aborted on the
  response's `close` before it finished (never `req` 'close', which fires as
  soon as the body is read on Node ≥ 16) and on plugin shutdown. Runners get
  its signal (lib/common/abort.js).
* Streaming responses start at once with an SSE keep-alive comment every
  15 s, so proxies with first-byte timeouts survive long silent thinking.
  Early errors then arrive as an SSE error event (SillyTavern shows it as a
  toast).
* Access: loopback Host allowlist (DNS rebinding); a non-loopback bind needs
  `ST_SUBSCRIPTIONS_TOKEN`. Model ids are validated before routing.

## Platform

* Nothing is ever spawned through a shell. Windows `.cmd` shims are resolved
  to the npm JS launcher they wrap and run with the current Node; a shim that
  cannot be resolved is refused. Resolution prefers `.exe`, then the
  package's JS launcher under the global `node_modules`, then native-installer
  paths, then PATH. Termux adds `$PREFIX/bin` and `$PREFIX/lib/node_modules`.
* Claude Code has no Android build; on Termux a binary is accepted only after
  `--version` actually runs. The supported route is proot-distro.
